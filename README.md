# Assignment 1 - 10 Problems

This repository contains solutions to 10 Java programming problems. Each problem is implemented as a separate Java file.

## Problem Descriptions

1. **Problem 1**
You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns minimum of them.

2. **Problem 2** 
You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
write the function that returns average of them.

3. **Problem 3** 
You are given a number “n”, write the function for checking
whether“n” is prime.

4. **Problem 4** 
You are given a number “n”, write the program using recursion for
finding “n!”

5. **Problem 5** 
You are given a number “n”, write the function for finding n-th
elements in Fibonacci sequence using recursion. (Fn = Fn-1+ Fn-2).
F0= 0, F1 = 1.

6. **Problem 6** 
You are given numbers “a” and “n”, write the function that returns “an”.

7. **Problem 7** 
You are given a string consisting of M distinct symbols. Print
all the permutations (all possible variants) of the symbols of this
string.

8. **Problem 8** 
You are given a string “s”, write the function for checking
whether “s” is all consists of digits.

9. **Problem 9** 
You are given numbers “n” and “k”, write the program that
finds C(n,k) (binomial coefficient) using formula.

10. **Problem 10** 
You are given “a” and “b”, write the function for finding
GCD(a, b) using recursion. (Hint: Euclidean Algorithm)

## How to Run

### Using IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click **File → Open...**, then select the project folder.
3. Wait for the project to load and index.
4. Open any `Problem_X.java` file.
5. Click the **Run** ▶️ button at the top, or right-click inside the file and select **Run 'Problem_X.main()'**.

### Using the Command Line
1. Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 21 recommended).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile a problem using:
   ```sh
   javac Problem_X.java
